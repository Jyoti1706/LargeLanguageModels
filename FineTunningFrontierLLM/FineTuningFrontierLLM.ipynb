       "  '💡 How many drum rollers does a Whirlpool dryer have? The number of drum rollers in a Whirlpool dryer depends on the specific model of the dryer. However, most dryers typically have 2 drum support rollers, which are located at the rear of the dryer drum. These rollers help support the weight of the drum and allow it to rotate smoothly during operation. Some newer models of Whirlpool dryers may have 4 drum rollers instead of 2, which can provide additional support and stability to the dryer drum.',\n",
       "  \"💡 Why do dryer rollers wear out? Dryer rollers can wear out due to factors such as frequent use of the dryer, lack of lubrication, overloading, debris and dirt buildup, and poor maintenance. Over time, the dryer drum's rotation on the rollers can create friction and wear them down. Regular lubrication is necessary to prevent excessive friction and premature wear and tear. To make your dryer rollers last longer, it's important to do routine maintenance and fix any problems in time.\"],\n",
